# Introduction
This repository will host the implementation for our paper "An Information-Theoretic Regularizer for Lossy Neural Image Compression". The code is currently under testing and will be released in the near future.

The released version will incorporate several optimizations and cleanups, which may differ slightly from the exact implementation used in our experiments. However, we claim that all reported results in the paper are reproducible.
